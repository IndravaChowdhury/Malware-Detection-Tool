# Malware Detection Tool

The Malware Detection Tool is a Python application designed to identify malware in executable files using a combination of YARA rules and signature-based detection methods. It provides detailed analysis of Portable Executable (PE) files and helps in detecting known malware patterns effectively.

## Features

- **YARA Rules Integration:** Custom YARA rules are used to detect specific malware patterns, including reverse TCP backdoors, which are often used in penetration testing and attacks.
- **Signature-Based Detection:** Detects known malware by matching binary signatures against a predefined set of patterns.
- **File Analysis:** Computes MD5 hashes, scans files for YARA rule matches, and checks for malware using signature patterns.
- **PE File Information Extraction:** Extracts and displays information about PE files, such as imported modules and exported functions.

 ## Installation

### Windows

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   https://github.com/IndravaChowdhury/Malware-Detection-Tool.git
   cd Malware-Detection-Tool
2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
5. **Requirments:**
   - Python 3.x
    - yara-python
    - pefile


### Linux

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   https://github.com/IndravaChowdhury/Malware-Detection-Tool.git
   cd Malware-Detection-Tool
2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
5. **Requirments:**
   - Python 3.x
    - yara-python
    - pefile


### Usage

1. **Run the Script:**
   ```bash
   python malware_detection.py
2. **Enter the File Path:**
   ```bash
   Enter the file path to check: /path/to/your/file.exe
The script will analyze the file for potential malware using YARA rules and binary signatures, and provide details on any matches found. It will also extract and display PE file information if applicable.

**Note:** Always use caution when handling potentially malicious files, and regularly update the tool for optimal performance.
